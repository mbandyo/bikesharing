# Bikeshare Project Proposal
The projects aims to build a presentation with visual aids for investor presentation. The investments are tageted for developing bike sharing programs in Des Moine.
## Data
Since this would be a new product for Des Moine area, there is no specific use data is available from the area. However, NYC has a matured bike rental business and data is available for a longer horizon. This data is used for preliminary analysis. We also need to keep in mind that availability NYC piublic and private transporations and parking issues, number of commuters and tourists would be different than the similar issues in Des Moine. So while the data may not be exactly replicable, it would give a reasonable idea regarding the viability of a bike rental business.
## Analysis
The presentation consists of a story built in Tableau using the ride sharing data from the month of August, 2019. </br>
* The first page (User Type) gives an idea of total number of bike rides and the proportions of regular subscribers vs. commuters. Subscribesrs are a stable source of revenue generation not majorly affected by seasonal variations. in NYC, 81% of riders are subscribers. This data provides a good idea of the size of inventory needed and also the stability of revenue stream. </br>
* The second page shows dat for starting locations and the indicator circle sizes are proportional to the count of bikes rented at that pick up center. </br>
* The third page (Checkout Times for Users), represents check out time (hour of day counted on 24 hour basis). This data provides an idea of the peak demand hours and would help inventory planning and rent tiering.</br>
* The fourth page provides checkout time (as previous page) by gender. This data provides information in planning inventory by suitability. For example, the proportion of female and male riders would determine the need for bike inventory.</br>
* The fifth page provides information on trip duration by hour of the day. This data helps the determination of churning of bikes for re-renting purpose.</br>
